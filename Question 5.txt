If I were to start a software company, I would choose Keerthan Raj Mateti as my Technical partner and Kusampudi soumith varma as my Business partner as my partners.I believe I am a Resilient leader and I believe I'm good at both technical and managemt . Firstly, I've selected them because I trust and know them very well. For any startup we need at least a couple of people with good technical knowledge and business knowledge for example in this case, Keerthan is very good at his coding skills and Soumith is very creative persons and he has very good problem solving skills.Secondly I've noticed their working pattern sometimes while working with them. Keerthan is very consistent with his work and Soumith has a very positive attitude throughout his/her progress. Which I believe are very crucial qualities that must be in a team of startups to continue in the long run. And last but not the least any team must have good communication. It avoids decision making conflicts, proper understanding of the project, sense of value for themselves in the team and much more. I can be free of worry in terms of having good communication and decision making with partners, as we had experience of working together for a project ,it went pretty well.
